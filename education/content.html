        <h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>
        <h3>Schnable Lab Opportunities</h3>
        <p>The Schnable lab currently provides paid research experiences to 25+ undergraduates. Most of these students
            are working one-on-one with research mentors to generate high-throughput data in areas such as gene
            discovery, gene mapping, and transposon biology.</p>

        <p>Selected undergraduate lab assistants also participate in an independent study course (Biol 490) that is
            conducted as an informal discussion group. Assigned readings from the scientific literature and popular
            press are used as a basis for discussions designed to introduce students to the diverse experimental
            approaches used in genetics and genomics research. One session per semester is devoted to issues surrounding
            graduate school admissions and expectations and the structure of science in the US (e.g., the processes by
            which research is funded and research findings disseminated). Another session is devoted to ethical issues
            surrounding sciences (e.g., GMOs).</p>
